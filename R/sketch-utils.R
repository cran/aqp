## fix overlap via random perterbation of affected elements
## this function is actually quite stupid as it can converge on bogus results
## scaled adjustments based on deviation from threshold distances would be better
## or, SANN style adjustments
##
## ideas:
## * cooling ala SANN -> smaller adjustments through time
## * perturbations should not increase overlap
## * debugging output
##
# x: vector of horizontal positions
# thresh: threshold at which overlap is a problem
# adj: adjustments are tested from runif(min=adj * -1, max=adj)
# min.x: left boundary condition
# max.x: right boundary condition
# maxIter: maximum number of iterations to attempt before collapsing to integer sequence
# trace: print diagnostics
