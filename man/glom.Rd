\title{
Return a "ragged" group of horizons selected from SoilProfileCollection
}
\description{
\code{glom()} returns a "clod" of horizons from a (often single profile) SoilProfileCollection that have a common attribute. You "glom" SPC horizons into a "clod". 

A clod is a "ragged" group of horizons. In this case, "ragged" means that number of horizons, horizon depths, distinctness and topography vary from pedon to pedon. 

All horizons included within the specified interval are returned in their entirety (not just the portion within the interval). A 'clod' references the original pedon data -- it is not resampled like \code{\link{slice}} or \code{\link{slab}}. 

If intersection at the specified boundaries [`z1`, `z2`] results in no horizon data, `NA` is returned with a warning containing the offending pedon ID. If the upper or lower bound is less than or greater than the shallowest top depth or deepest bottom depth, respectively, a warning is issued, but the horizons within the interval are returned as usual. End users should handle the possibility of incomplete pedons using \code{\link{evalMissingData}} or similar approach.

Horizon intersection is based on unique ID \code{hzidname(spc)} and attribute of interest.

Currently, just depth/depth intervals are supported as common attribute for creating a clod i.e. all horizons overlapping interval 25 to 100 cm -- but many other attributes are possible and will be implemented perhaps via formula interface similar to \code{slice}.

\usage{
glom(p, z1, z2 = NA, as.data.frame = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{p}{
A single-profile SoilProfileCollection; e.g. \code{glom} is called via \code{profileApply()}
}
  \item{z1}{
Top depth (required) - depth to intersect horizon at; if `z2` specified, top depth of intersect interval.
}
  \item{z2}{
OPTIONAL: Bottom depth - bottom depth of intersection interval
}
  \item{as.data.frame}{
OPTIONAL: return a data.frame, by intersection with horizons(p)? default: FALSE
}
}
\value{
data.frame or SoilProfileCllection representation of the "clod" of horizons that have a common depth range
