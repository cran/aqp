\title{Attempt to fix overlapping sketches when using relative horizontal spacing.}

\description{This is a very simple optimization algorithm for adjusting horizontal sketch positions until affected profiles are farter apart than a given threshold. Rank-ordering and boundary conditions are enforced on the adjustments. Failure to converge within \code{maxIter} results in an integer sequence.}

\usage{
fixOverlap(x, thresh = 0.6, adj = 0.2, 
min.x = 0.8, max.x = length(x) + 0.2, 
maxIter = 1000, trace = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{vector of relative horizontal positions, one for each profile}
  \item{thresh}{horizontal threshold defining "overlap", must be < 1, ideal values likely in [0.3, 0.8]}
  \item{adj}{adjustments are tested within \code{runif(min=adj * -1, max=adj)}}
  \item{min.x}{left-side boundary condition}
  \item{max.x}{right-side boundary condition}
  \item{maxIter}{maximum number of iterations to attempt before giving up and returning integer sequence}
  \item{trace}{print diagnostics}
}


\value{a vector of the same length as \code{x}, preserving rank-ordering and boundary conditions.}

\note{This is a very naeve function and may fail to converge on a reasonable solution. SANN would be a much more robust framework.}
